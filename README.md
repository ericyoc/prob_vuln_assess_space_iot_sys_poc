# Space IoT Vulnerability Assessment Tool

## Overview

This Python-based tool conducts a probabilistic vulnerability assessment for Space IoT systems. It leverages data from the National Vulnerability Database (NVD) and VarIoT Database to provide a comprehensive analysis of potential security risks in space-based IoT deployments.

## Features

- Data retrieval from NVD and VarIoT databases
- Monte Carlo simulation for probabilistic risk assessment
- Comparison of probabilistic and Euclidean distance-based vulnerability scoring
- Visualization of vulnerability score distributions
- Statistical analysis of results

## Concepts and Approach

### Probabilistic Vulnerability Assessment
Utilizes Monte Carlo simulation to account for uncertainties in space environments. Each vulnerability is assigned a space context factor to reflect potentially increased severity in space applications.

### Euclidean Distance-Based Assessment
Calculates Euclidean distance-based scores to measure deviation from mean severity, helping identify outlier vulnerabilities.

### Comparative Analysis
Performs statistical comparison between probabilistic and Euclidean approaches, offering insights into different aspects of vulnerability severity in Space IoT contexts.

## Vulnerability Selection Criteria

Vulnerabilities are selected based on relevance to Space IoT systems:

1. Applicability to space-based embedded systems and IoT devices
2. Relevance to satellite network communication protocols
3. Potential impact on critical space operations
4. Suitability for low-power, resource-constrained devices
5. Security issues in long-distance, high-latency communication
6. Threats specific to harsh space environments
7. Vulnerabilities in ground station systems interacting with space-based IoT

## Usage

```python
python space_iot_vulnerability_assessment.py
```

Ensure `nvd_and_variot_api_keys.txt` contains required API keys for NVD and VarIoT databases.

## Interpretation of Results

- The system-wide scores represent the total vulnerability across all identified vulnerabilities.
- Individual scores (Probabilistic and Euclidean) represent the severity of single vulnerabilities.
- The large difference between system-wide and individual scores is due to the cumulative effect of multiple vulnerabilities.
- The statistical difference between Probabilistic and Euclidean scores suggests they capture different aspects of vulnerability severity.
- Probabilistic scores incorporate the space context factor and random variations, reflecting potential real-world fluctuations.
- Euclidean scores measure how much each vulnerability deviates from the average, highlighting outliers.

## Implications for Space IoT Security

1. System-wide vulnerability assessment indicates a need for a holistic security approach.
2. Individual vulnerability scores highlight the importance of context in risk assessment.
3. The combination of Probabilistic and Euclidean methods provides a comprehensive view of the system's security posture.
4. Regular reassessment is crucial due to potential fluctuations in overall vulnerability.
5. Resource allocation should prioritize vulnerabilities with high scores in both methods.
