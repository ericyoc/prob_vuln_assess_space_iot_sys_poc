# Space IoT Vulnerability Assessment Tool

## Overview

This Python-based tool conducts a probabilistic vulnerability assessment for Space IoT systems. It leverages data from the National Vulnerability Database (NVD) and VarIoT Database to provide a comprehensive analysis of potential security risks in space-based IoT deployments.

## Features

- Data retrieval from NVD and VarIoT databases
- Monte Carlo simulation for probabilistic risk assessment
- Comparison of probabilistic and Euclidean distance-based vulnerability scoring
- Visualization of vulnerability score distributions
- Statistical analysis of results

## Concepts and Approach

### Probabilistic Vulnerability Assessment
Utilizes Monte Carlo simulation to account for uncertainties in space environments. Each vulnerability is assigned a space context factor to reflect potentially increased severity in space applications.

### Euclidean Distance-Based Assessment
Calculates Euclidean distance-based scores to measure deviation from mean severity, helping identify outlier vulnerabilities.

### Comparative Analysis
Performs statistical comparison between probabilistic and Euclidean approaches, offering insights into different aspects of vulnerability severity in Space IoT contexts.

## Vulnerability Selection Criteria

Vulnerabilities are selected based on relevance to Space IoT systems:

1. Applicability to space-based embedded systems and IoT devices
2. Relevance to satellite network communication protocols
3. Potential impact on critical space operations
4. Suitability for low-power, resource-constrained devices
5. Security issues in long-distance, high-latency communication
6. Threats specific to harsh space environments
7. Vulnerabilities in ground station systems interacting with space-based IoT

## Usage

```python
python space_iot_vulnerability_assessment.py
```

Ensure `nvd_and_variot_api_keys.txt` contains required API keys for NVD and VarIoT databases.

Vulnerability Selection Criteria:
The vulnerabilities analyzed in this assessment were selected based on their relevance to Space IoT systems. The selection criteria include:
1. Applicability to embedded systems and IoT devices commonly used in space applications.
2. Relevance to communication protocols and technologies used in satellite and space-based networks.
3. Potential impact on critical space operations, including data transmission, remote sensing, and navigation.
4. Vulnerabilities affecting low-power, resource-constrained devices typical in space IoT.
5. Security issues related to long-distance, high-latency communication characteristic of space systems.
6. Threats specific to the harsh environmental conditions of space (e.g., radiation effects on hardware).
7. Vulnerabilities in ground station systems that interact with space-based IoT devices.

These criteria ensure that the vulnerabilities analyzed are particularly relevant to the unique challenges and constraints of Space IoT systems. This focused approach allows for a more accurate assessment of the specific risks faced by these specialized IoT deployments in space environments.

Interpretation:
- The system-wide scores represent the total vulnerability across all identified vulnerabilities.
- Individual scores (Probabilistic and Euclidean) represent the severity of single vulnerabilities.
- The large difference between system-wide and individual scores is due to the cumulative effect of multiple vulnerabilities.
- The statistical difference between Probabilistic and Euclidean scores suggests they capture different aspects of vulnerability severity.
- The high T-statistic (57.0059) indicates a large standardized difference between the Probabilistic and Euclidean scoring methods.
- The p-value of 0.0 suggests that this difference is statistically significant, not due to random chance.
- This implies that the Probabilistic and Euclidean methods are capturing fundamentally different aspects of vulnerability:
  * Probabilistic scores incorporate the space context factor and random variations, reflecting potential real-world fluctuations.
  * Euclidean scores measure how much each vulnerability deviates from the average, highlighting outliers.

Implications for Space IoT Security:
1. System-wide vulnerability:
   - The large total scores indicate that the cumulative effect of multiple vulnerabilities is substantial.
   - This suggests a need for a holistic approach to security, addressing multiple vulnerabilities simultaneously.

2. Individual vulnerability assessment:
   - The difference between Probabilistic and Euclidean scores for individual vulnerabilities shows the importance of context in risk assessment.
   - Probabilistic scores may better reflect the dynamic nature of space environments.
   - Euclidean scores help identify vulnerabilities that are significantly different from the norm.

3. Security strategy:
   - Use Probabilistic scores for day-to-day risk management and prioritization.
   - Use Euclidean scores to identify outlier vulnerabilities that may require special attention.
   - The combination of both methods provides a more comprehensive view of the system's security posture.

4. Continuous monitoring:
   - The variation between minimum and maximum total scores suggests that the system's overall vulnerability can fluctuate.
   - Regular reassessment is crucial to capture changes in the threat landscape and system configuration.

5. Resource allocation:
   - Prioritize resources based on vulnerabilities with high scores in both Probabilistic and Euclidean methods.
   - Consider the system-wide scores when determining overall security budgets and efforts.

Conclusion:
This analysis provides a nuanced view of vulnerabilities in the space IoT system.
By combining Probabilistic and Euclidean approaches, we gain insights into both the dynamic nature of space-based risks
and the relative severity of individual vulnerabilities. This dual perspective enables more informed decision-making
in securing complex space IoT environments.
