Prior to version 14.3.0, using a forged HOST header in the default configuration of packaged installations and using the ""Login required"" setting, an attacker could redirect to a remote host to initiate a phishing attack against an OpenProject user's account. This vulnerability affects default packaged installation of OpenProject without any additional configuration or modules on Apache (such as mod_security, manually setting a host name, having a fallthrough VirtualHost). It might also affect other installations that did not take care to fix the HOST/X-Forwarded-Host headers.

CVE-2024-41013,0,"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

xfs: don't walk off the end of a directory data block

This adds sanity checks for xfs_dir2_data_unused and xfs_dir2_data_entry
to make sure don't stray beyond valid memory region. Before patching, the
loop simply checks that the start offset of the dup and dep is within the
range. So in a crafted image, if last entry is xfs_dir2_data_unused, we
can change dup->length to dup->length-1 and leave 1 byte of space. In the
next traversal, this space will be considered as dup or dep. We may
encounter an out of bound read when accessing the fixed members.

In the patch, we make sure that the remaining bytes large enough to hold
an unused entry before accessing xfs_dir2_data_unused and
xfs_dir2_data_unused is XFS_DIR2_DATA_ALIGN byte aligned. We also make
sure that the remaining bytes large enough to hold a dirent with a

There is a lack of verification of the space occupied by fixed members

We can create a crafted image to trigger an out of bounds read by
following these steps:
    1) Mount an image of xfs, and do some file operations to leave records
    2) Before umounting, copy the image for subsequent steps to simulate
       abnormal exit. Because umount will ensure that tail_blk and
       head_blk are the same, which will result in the inability to enter

There is no support for HWPOISON, MEMORY_FAILURE, or ARCH_HAS_COPY_MC on

Fix this by treating VM_FAULT_HWPOISON the same as VM_FAULT_SIGBUS, similar

USB: core: Fix duplicate endpoint bug by clearing reserved bits in the descriptor

Syzbot has identified a bug in usbcore (see the Closes: tag below)
caused by our assumption that the reserved bits in an endpoint
descriptor's bEndpointAddress field will always be 0.  As a result of
the bug, the endpoint_is_duplicate() routine in config.c (and possibly
other routines as well) may believe that two descriptors are for
distinct endpoints, even though they have the same direction and
endpoint number.  This can lead to confusion, including the bug
identified by syzbot (two descriptors with matching endpoint numbers
and directions, where one was interrupt and the other was bulk).

To fix the bug, we will clear the reserved bits in bEndpointAddress
when we parse the descriptor.  (Note that both the USB-2.0 and USB-3.1
specs say these bits are ""Reserved, reset to zero"".)  This requires us

udp: Set SOCK_RCU_FREE earlier in udp_lib_get_port().

syzkaller triggered the warning [0] in udp_v4_early_demux().

In udp_v[46]_early_demux() and sk_lookup(), we do not touch the refcount
of the looked-up sk and use sock_pfree() as skb->destructor, so we check
SOCK_RCU_FREE to ensure that the sk is safe to access during the RCU grace
period.

Currently, SOCK_RCU_FREE is flagged for a bound socket after being put
into the hash table.  Moreover, the SOCK_RCU_FREE check is done too early
in udp_v[46]_early_demux() and sk_lookup(), so there could be a small race

CVE-2024-41042,0,"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

netfilter: nf_tables: prefer nft_chain_validate

nft_chain_validate already performs loop detection because a cycle will
result in a call stack overflow (ctx->level >= NFT_JUMP_STACK_SIZE).

It also follows maps via ->validate callback in nft_lookup, so there
appears no reason to iterate the maps again.

nf_tables_check_loops() and all its helper functions can be removed.
This improves ruleset load time significantly, from 23s down to 12s.

This also fixes a crash bug. Old loop detection code can result in
unbounded recursion:

I can't see any actual reason to attempt to check for this from
nft_validate_register_store(), at this point the transaction is still in
progress, so we don't have a full picture of the rule graph.

CVE-2024-41045,0,"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

bpf: Defer work in bpf_timer_cancel_and_free

Currently, the same case as previous patch (two timer callbacks trying
to cancel each other) can be invoked through bpf_map_update_elem as
well, or more precisely, freeing map elements containing timers. Since
this relies on hrtimer_cancel as well, it is prone to the same deadlock
situation as the previous patch.

It would be sufficient to use hrtimer_try_to_cancel to fix this problem,
as the timer cannot be enqueued after async_cancel_and_free. Once
async_cancel_and_free has been done, the timer must be reinitialized
before it can be armed again. The callback running in parallel trying to
arm the timer will fail, and freeing bpf_hrtimer without waiting is
sufficient (given kfree_rcu), and bpf_timer_cb will return
HRTIMER_NORESTART, preventing the timer from being rearmed again.

However, there exists a UAF scenario where the callback arms the timer
before entering this function, such that if cancellation fails (due to
timer callback invoking this routine, or the target timer callback
running concurrently). In such a case, if the timer expiration is
significantly far in the future, the RCU grace period expiration
happening before it will free the bpf_hrtimer state and along with it
the struct hrtimer, that is enqueued.

Hence, it is clear cancellation needs to occur after
async_cancel_and_free, and yet it cannot be done inline due to deadlock
issues. We thus modify bpf_timer_cancel_and_free to defer work to the
global workqueue, adding a work_struct alongside rcu_head (both used at
_different_ points of time, so can share space).

i40e: Fix XDP program unloading while removing the driver

The commit 6533e558c650 (""i40e: Fix reset path while removing

modifying the XDP program while the driver is being removed.
Unfortunately, such a change is useful only if the "".ndo_bpf()""
callback was called out of the rmmod context because unloading the
existing XDP program is also a part of driver removing procedure.
In other words, from the rmmod context the driver is expected to
unload the XDP program without reporting any errors. Otherwise,
the kernel warning with callstack is printed out to dmesg.

Example failing scenario:
 1. Load the i40e driver.
 2. Load the XDP program.
 3. Unload the i40e driver (using ""rmmod"" command).

This crash happens every time when running sockmap_skb_verdict_shutdown
subtest in sockmap_basic.

This crash is because a NULL pointer is passed to page_address() in the
sk_msg_recvmsg(). Due to the different implementations depending on the
architecture, page_address(NULL) will trigger a panic on Loongarch
platform but not on x86 platform. So this bug was hidden on x86 platform
for a while, but now it is exposed on Loongarch platform. The root cause
is that a zero length skb (skb->len == 0) was put on the queue.

This zero length skb is a TCP FIN packet, which was sent by shutdown(),
invoked in test_sockmap_skb_verdict_shutdown():

	shutdown(p1, SHUT_WR);

In this case, in sk_psock_skb_ingress_enqueue(), num_sge is zero, and no
page is put to this sge (see sg_set_page in sg_set_page), but this empty
sge is queued into ingress_msg list.

And in sk_msg_recvmsg(), this empty sge is used, and a NULL page is got by
sg_page(sge). Pass this NULL page to copy_page_to_iter(), which passes it
to kmap_local_page() and to page_address(), then kernel panics.

To solve this, we should skip this zero length skb. So in sk_msg_recvmsg(),
if copy is zero, that means it's a zero length skb, skip invoking
copy_page_to_iter(). We are using the EFAULT return triggered by
copy_page_to_iter to check for is_fin in tcp_bpf.c.",1.396325097

closed until the daemon exits. Therefore read requests waiting for reopen

CVE-2024-41066,0,"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ibmvnic: Add tx check to prevent skb leak

Below is a summary of how the driver stores a reference to an skb during
transmit:
    tx_buff[free_map[consumer_index]]->skb = new_skb;
    free_map[consumer_index] = IBMVNIC_INVALID_MAP;
    consumer_index ++;
Where variable data looks like this:
    free_map == [4, IBMVNIC_INVALID_MAP, IBMVNIC_INVALID_MAP, 0, 3]
                                               	consumer_index^
    tx_buff == [skb=null, skb=<ptr>, skb=<ptr>, skb=null, skb=null]

The driver has checks to ensure that free_map[consumer_index] pointed to
a valid index but there was no check to ensure that this index pointed
to an unused/null skb address. So, if, by some chance, our free_map and
tx_buff lists become out of sync then we were previously risking an
skb memory leak. This could then cause tcp congestion control to stop
sending packets, eventually leading to ETIMEDOUT.

Therefore, add a conditional to ensure that the skb address is null. If
not then warn the user (because this is still a bug that should be
patched) and free the old pointer to prevent memleak/tcp problems.",1.031691553
CVE-2024-41067,0,"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

btrfs: scrub: handle RST lookup error correctly

[BUG]
When running btrfs/060 with forced RST feature, it would crash the
following ASSERT() inside scrub_read_endio():

	ASSERT(sector_nr < stripe->nr_sectors);

Before that, we would have tree dump from
btrfs_get_raid_extent_offset(), as we failed to find the RST entry for
the range.

[CAUSE]
Inside scrub_submit_extent_sector_read() every time we allocated a new
bbio we immediately called btrfs_map_block() to make sure there was some
RST range covering the scrub target.

But if btrfs_map_block() fails, we immediately call endio for the bbio,
while the bbio is newly allocated, it's completely empty.

Then inside scrub_read_endio(), we go through the bvecs to find
the sector number (as bi_sector is no longer reliable if the bio is
submitted to lower layers).

And since the bio is empty, such bvecs iteration would not find any
sector matching the sector, and return sector_nr == stripe->nr_sectors,
triggering the ASSERT().

[FIX]
Instead of calling btrfs_map_block() after allocating a new bbio, call
btrfs_map_block() first.

Since our only objective of calling btrfs_map_block() is only to update
stripe_len, there is really no need to do that after btrfs_alloc_bio().

This new timing would avoid the problem of handling empty bbio
completely, and in fact fixes a possible race window for the old code,
where if the submission thread is the only owner of the pending_io, the
scrub would never finish (since we didn't decrease the pending_io
counter).

Although the root cause of RST lookup failure still needs to be
addressed.",1.387700013

KVM: PPC: Book3S HV: Prevent UAF in kvm_spapr_tce_attach_iommu_group()

Al reported a possible use-after-free (UAF) in kvm_spapr_tce_attach_iommu_group().

It looks up `stt` from tablefd, but then continues to use it after doing
fdput() on the returned fd. After the fdput() the tablefd is free to be
closed by another thread. The close calls kvm_spapr_tce_release() and
then release_spapr_tce_table() (via call_rcu()) which frees `stt`.

Although there are calls to rcu_read_lock() in
kvm_spapr_tce_attach_iommu_group() they are not sufficient to prevent
the UAF, because `stt` is used outside the locked regions.

With an artifcial delay after the fdput() and a userspace program which

In the past, there were similar failures reported by CI from other IGT
tests, observed on other platforms.

Before commit 63baf4f3d587 (""drm/i915/gt: Only wait for GPU activity
before unbinding a GGTT fence""), i915_vma_revoke_fence() was waiting for
idleness of vma->active via fence_update().   That commit introduced
vma->fence->active in order for the fence_update() to be able to wait
selectively on that one instead of vma->active since only idleness of
fence registers was needed.  But then, another commit 0d86ee35097a
(""drm/i915/gt: Make fence revocation unequivocal"") replaced the call to
fence_update() in i915_vma_revoke_fence() with only fence_write(), and
also added that GEM_BUG_ON(!i915_active_is_idle(&fence->active)) in front.
No justification was provided on why we might then expect idleness of
vma->fence->active without first waiting on it.

The issue can be potentially caused by a race among revocation of fence
registers on one side and sequential execution of signal callbacks invoked
on completion of a request that was using them on the other, still
processed in parallel to revocation of those fence registers.  Fix it by
waiting for idleness of vma->fence->active in i915_vma_revoke_fence().

Syzbot is still reporting quite an old issue [1] that occurs due to

Fix the issue by verifying that required endpoint types are present

Status Register (SBSR):

 # devlink sb occupancy snapshot pci/0000:01:00.0
 # devlink sb occupancy clearmax pci/0000:01:00.0

The register has two masks of 256 bits to denote on which ingress /
egress ports the register should operate on. Spectrum-4 has more than
256 ports, so the register was extended by cited commit with a new
'port_page' field.

However, when filling the register's payload, the driver specifies the
ports as absolute numbers and not relative to the first port of the port
page, resulting in memory corruptions [1].

Fix by specifying the ports relative to the first port of the port page.

CVE-2024-42077,5.5,"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ocfs2: fix DIO failure due to insufficient transaction credits

The code in ocfs2_dio_end_io_write() estimates number of necessary
transaction credits using ocfs2_calc_extend_credits().  This however does
not take into account that the IO could be arbitrarily large and can
contain arbitrary number of extents.

Extent tree manipulations do often extend the current transaction but not
in all of the cases.  For example if we have only single block extents in
the tree, ocfs2_mark_extent_written() will end up calling
ocfs2_replace_extent_rec() all the time and we will never extend the
current transaction and eventually exhaust all the transaction credits if
the IO contains many single block extents.  Once that happens a
WARN_ON(jbd2_handle_buffer_credits(handle) <= 0) is triggered in
jbd2_journal_dirty_metadata() and subsequently OCFS2 aborts in response to
this error.  This was actually triggered by one of our customers on a
heavily fragmented OCFS2 filesystem.

To fix the issue make sure the transaction always has enough credits for
one extent insert before each call of ocfs2_mark_extent_written().

xdp: Remove WARN() from __xdp_reg_mem_model()

syzkaller reports a warning in __xdp_reg_mem_model().

The warning occurs only if __mem_id_init_hash_table() returns an error. It
returns the error in two cases:

  1. memory allocation fails;
  2. rhashtable_init() fails when some fields of rhashtable_params
     struct are not initialized properly.

The second case cannot happen since there is a static const rhashtable_params
struct with valid fields. So, warning is only triggered when there is a
problem with memory allocation.

Thus, there is no sense in using WARN() to handle this error and it can be
safely removed.

ionic: fix kernel panic due to multi-buffer handling

Currently, the ionic_run_xdp() doesn't handle multi-buffer packets

When a jumbo frame is received, the ionic_run_xdp() first makes xdp
frame with all necessary pages in the rx descriptor.

dma-mapping and reset page pointer to NULL for all pages, not only the

isn't really all that relevant any more to begin with, but it also ends
up making assumptions based on the stack layout that aren't necessarily
valid.

Basically, the code tries to account the time spent in spinlocks to the
caller rather than the spinlock, and while I support that as a concept,
it's not worth the code complexity or the KASAN warnings when no serious
profiling is done using timers anyway these days.

And the code really does depend on stack layout that is only true in the
simplest of cases.  We've lost the comment at some point (I think when
the 32-bit and 64-bit code was unified), but it used to say:

	Assume the lock function has either no stack frame or a copy
	of eflags from PUSHF.

which explains why it just blindly loads a word or two straight off the
stack pointer and then takes a minimal look at the values to just check
if they might be eflags or the return pc:

	Eflags always has bits 22 and up cleared unlike kernel addresses

but that basic stack layout assumption assumes that there isn't any lock
debugging etc going on that would complicate the code and cause a stack
frame.

It causes KASAN unhappiness reported for years by syzkaller [1] and
others [2].

With no real practical reason for this any more, just remove the code.

Just for historical interest, here's some background commits relating to
this code from 2006:

  0cb91a229364 (""i386: Account spinlocks to the caller during profiling for !FP kernels"")
  31679f38d886 (""Simplify profile_pc on x86-64"")

and a code unification from 2009:

  ef4512882dbe (""x86: time_32/64.c unify profile_pc"")

but the basics of this thing actually goes back to before the git tree.",1.450517499
CVE-2024-42097,0,"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

CVE-2024-42098,0,"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

crypto: ecdh - explicitly zeroize private_key

private_key is overwritten with the key parameter passed in by the
caller (if present), or alternatively a newly generated private key.
However, it is possible that the caller provides a key (or the newly
generated key) which is shorter than the previous key. In that
scenario, some key material from the previous key would not be
overwritten. The easiest solution is to explicitly zeroize the entire
private_key array first.

Note that this patch slightly changes the behavior of this function:
previously, if the ecc_gen_privkey failed, the old private_key would
remain. Now, the private_key is always zeroized. This behavior is
consistent with the case where params.key is set and ecc_is_key_valid
fails.",1.069660149

Patch series ""mm: Avoid possible overflows in dirty throttling"".

Dirty throttling logic assumes dirty limits in page units fit into
32-bits.  This patch series makes sure this is true (see patch 2/2 for
more details).


This patch (of 2):

This reverts commit 9319b647902cbd5cc884ac08a8a6d54ce111fc78.

The commit is broken in several ways.  Firstly, the removed (u64) cast
from the multiplication will introduce a multiplication overflow on 32-bit
archs if wb_thresh * bg_thresh >= 1<<32 (which is actually common - the
default settings with 4GB of RAM will trigger this).  Secondly, the
div64_u64() is unnecessarily expensive on 32-bit archs.  We have
div64_ul() in case we want to be safe & cheap.  Thirdly, if dirty
thresholds are larger than 1<<32 pages, then dirty balancing is going to
blow up in many other spectacular ways anyway so trying to fix one
possible overflow is just moot.",1.222694773

btrfs: fix adding block group to a reclaim list and the unused list during reclaim

There is a potential parallel list adding for retrying in
btrfs_reclaim_bgs_work and adding to the unused list. Since the block
group is removed from the reclaim list and it is on a relocation work,
it can be added into the unused list in parallel. When that happens,
adding it to the reclaim list will corrupt the list head and trigger
list corruption like below.

There is a similar retry_list code in btrfs_delete_unused_bgs(), but it is
safe, AFAICS. Since the block group was in the unused list, the used bytes
should be 0 when it was added to the unused list. Then, it checks
block_group->{used,reserved,pinned} are still 0 under the
block_group->lock. So, they should be still eligible for the unused list,
not the reclaim list.

The reason it is safe there it's because because we're holding
space_info->groups_sem in write mode.

That means no other task can allocate from the block group, so while we
are at deleted_unused_bgs() it's not possible for other tasks to
allocate and deallocate extents from the block group, so it can't be
added to the unused list or the reclaim list by anyone else.

The bug can be reproduced by btrfs/166 after a few rounds. In practice
this can be hit when relocation cannot find more chunk space and ends
with ENOSPC.",1.437258846
CVE-2024-42104,0,"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

nilfs2: add missing check for inode numbers on directory entries

Syzbot reported that mounting and unmounting a specific pattern of
corrupted nilfs2 filesystem images causes a use-after-free of metadata
file inodes, which triggers a kernel bug in lru_add_fn().

As Jan Kara pointed out, this is because the link count of a metadata file
gets corrupted to 0, and nilfs_evict_inode(), which is called from iput(),
tries to delete that inode (ifile inode in this case).

The inconsistency occurs because directories containing the inode numbers
of these metadata files that should not be visible in the namespace are
read without checking.

Fix this issue by treating the inode numbers of these internal files as
errors in the sanity check helper when reading directory folios/pages.

Also thanks to Hillf Danton and Matthew Wilcox for their initial mm-layer
analysis.",1.023024415
CVE-2024-42105,0,"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

nilfs2: fix inode number range checks

Patch series ""nilfs2: fix potential issues related to reserved inodes"".

This series fixes one use-after-free issue reported by syzbot, caused by
nilfs2's internal inode being exposed in the namespace on a corrupted
filesystem, and a couple of flaws that cause problems if the starting
number of non-reserved inodes written in the on-disk super block is
intentionally (or corruptly) changed from its default value.  


This patch (of 3):

In the current implementation of nilfs2, ""nilfs->ns_first_ino"", which
gives the first non-reserved inode number, is read from the superblock,
but its lower limit is not checked.

As a result, if a number that overlaps with the inode number range of
reserved inodes such as the root directory or metadata files is set in the
super block parameter, the inode number test macros (NILFS_MDT_INODE and
NILFS_VALID_INODE) will not function properly.

In addition, these test macros use left bit-shift calculations using with
the inode number as the shift count via the BIT macro, but the result of a
shift calculation that exceeds the bit width of an integer is undefined in
the C specification, so if ""ns_first_ino"" is set to a large value other
than the default value NILFS_USER_INO (=11), the macros may potentially
malfunction depending on the environment.

Fix these issues by checking the lower bound of ""nilfs->ns_first_ino"" and
by preventing bit shifts equal to or greater than the NILFS_USER_INO
constant in the inode number test macros.

Also, change the type of ""ns_first_ino"" from signed integer to unsigned
integer to avoid the need for type casting in comparisons such as the
lower bound check introduced this time.",1.345059662
CVE-2024-42106,0,"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

inet_diag: Initialize pad field in struct inet_diag_req_v2

KMSAN reported uninit-value access in raw_lookup() [1]. Diag for raw
sockets uses the pad field in struct inet_diag_req_v2 for the
underlying protocol. This field corresponds to the sdiag_raw_protocol
field in struct inet_diag_req_raw.

inet_diag_get_exact_compat() converts inet_diag_req to
inet_diag_req_v2, but leaves the pad field uninitialized. So the issue
occurs when raw_lookup() accesses the sdiag_raw_protocol field.

Fix this by initializing the pad field in
inet_diag_get_exact_compat(). Also, do the same fix in
inet_diag_dump_compat() to avoid the similar issue in the future.

And it also pinned it down to commit b5357cb268c4 (""btrfs: qgroup: do not
check qgroup inherit if qgroup is disabled"").

[CAUSE]
That offending commit skips the whole qgroup inherit check if qgroup is
not enabled.

But that also skips the very basic checks like
num_ref_copies/num_excl_copies and the structure size checks.

Meaning if a qgroup enable/disable race is happening at the background,
and we pass a btrfs_qgroup_inherit structure when the qgroup is
disabled, the check would be completely skipped.

Then at the time of transaction commitment, qgroup is re-enabled and
btrfs_qgroup_inherit() is going to use the incorrect structure and
causing the above KASAN error.

[FIX]
Make btrfs_qgroup_check_inherit() only skip the source qgroup checks.
So that even if invalid btrfs_qgroup_inherit structure is passed in, we
can still reject invalid ones no matter if qgroup is enabled or not.

Furthermore we do already have an extra safety inside
btrfs_qgroup_inherit(), which would just ignore invalid qgroup sources,
so even if we only skip the qgroup source check we're still safe.",1.084131008

The parameter passed to kfree was 5a5a5a5a, which corresponds to the target field of
the jffs_inode_info structure. It was found that all variables in the jffs_inode_info
structure were 5a5a5a5a, except for the first member sem. It is suspected that these
variables are not initialized because they were set to 5a5a5a5a during memory testing,
which is meant to detect uninitialized memory.The sem variable is initialized in the
function jffs2_i_init_once, while other members are initialized in
the function jffs2_init_inode_info.

The function jffs2_init_inode_info is called after iget_locked,
but in the iget_locked function, the destroy_inode process is triggered,
which releases the inode and consequently, the target member of the inode
is not initialized.In concurrent high pressure scenarios, iget_locked
may enter the destroy_inode branch as described in the code.

Since the destroy_inode functionality of jffs2 only releases the target,
the fix method is to set target to NULL in jffs2_i_init_once.",1.08708505

igc: fix a log entry using uninitialized netdev

During successful probe, igc logs this:

on a partially uninitialized netdev.

Fix this by calling igc_ptp_init() after register_netdev(), right

just as in igb.

dirty_bytes / dirty_background_bytes interfaces we can just refuse to set
so large limits.  For dirty_ratio / dirty_background_ratio it isn't so
simple as the dirty limit is computed from the amount of available memory
which can change due to memory hotplug etc.  So when converting dirty

Bluetooth: qca: Fix BT enable failure again for QCA6390 after warm reboot

Commit 272970be3dab (""Bluetooth: hci_qca: Fix driver shutdown on closed
serdev"") will cause below regression issue:

BT can't be enabled after below steps:
cold boot -> enable BT -> disable BT -> warm reboot -> BT enable failure
if property enable-gpios is not configured within DT|ACPI for QCA6390.

The commit is to fix a use-after-free issue within qca_serdev_shutdown()
by adding condition to avoid the serdev is flushed or wrote after closed
but also introduces this regression issue regarding above steps since the
VSC is not sent to reset controller during warm reboot.

Fixed by sending the VSC to reset controller within qca_serdev_shutdown()
once BT was ever enabled, and the use-after-free issue is also fixed by
this change since the serdev is still opened before it is flushed or wrote.

bnx2x: Fix multiple UBSAN array-index-out-of-bounds

Fix UBSAN warnings that occur when using a system with 32 physical
cpu cores or more, or when the user defines a number of Ethernet
queues greater than or equal to FP_SB_MAX_E1x using the num_queues
module parameter.

Currently there is a read/write out of bounds that occurs on the array
""struct stats_query_entry query"" present inside the ""bnx2x_fw_stats_req""
struct in ""drivers/net/ethernet/broadcom/bnx2x/bnx2x.h"".
Looking at the definition of the ""struct stats_query_entry query"" array:

struct stats_query_entry query[FP_SB_MAX_E1x+
         BNX2X_FIRST_QUEUE_QUERY_IDX];

FP_SB_MAX_E1x is defined as the maximum number of fast path interrupts and
has a value of 16, while BNX2X_FIRST_QUEUE_QUERY_IDX has a value of 3
meaning the array has a total size of 19.
Since accesses to ""struct stats_query_entry query"" are offset-ted by
BNX2X_FIRST_QUEUE_QUERY_IDX, that means that the total number of Ethernet
queues should not exceed FP_SB_MAX_E1x (16). However one of these queues
is reserved for FCOE and thus the number of Ethernet queues should be set
to [FP_SB_MAX_E1x -1] (15) if FCOE is enabled or [FP_SB_MAX_E1x] (16) if
it is not.

This is also described in a comment in the source code in
drivers/net/ethernet/broadcom/bnx2x/bnx2x.h just above the Macro definition
of FP_SB_MAX_E1x. Below is the part of this explanation that it important
for this patch

/*
  * The total number of L2 queues, MSIX vectors and HW contexts (CIDs) is
  * control by the number of fast-path status blocks supported by the
  * device (HW/FW). Each fast-path status block (FP-SB) aka non-default
  * status block represents an independent interrupts context that can
  * serve a regular L2 networking queue. However special L2 queues such
  * as the FCoE queue do not require a FP-SB and other components like
  * the CNIC may consume FP-SB reducing the number of possible L2 queues
  *
  * If the maximum number of FP-SB available is X then:
  * a. If CNIC is supported it consumes 1 FP-SB thus the max number of
  *    regular L2 queues is Y=X-1
  * b. In MF mode the actual number of L2 queues is Y= (X-1/MF_factor)
  * c. If the FCoE L2 queue is supported the actual number of L2 queues
  *    is Y+1
  * d. The number of irqs (MSIX vectors) is either Y+1 (one extra for
  *    slow-path interrupts) or Y+2 if CNIC is supported (one additional
  *    FP interrupt context for the CNIC).
  * e. The number of HW context (CID count) is always X or X+1 if FCoE
  *    L2 queue is supported. The cid for the FCoE L2 queue is always X.
  */

However this driver also supports NICs that use the E2 controller which can
handle more queues due to having more FP-SB represented by FP_SB_MAX_E2.
Looking at the commits when the E2 support was added, it was originally
using the E1x parameters: commit f2e0899f0f27 (""bnx2x: Add 57712 support"").
Back then FP_SB_MAX_E2 was set to 16 the same as E1x. However the driver
was later updated to take full advantage of the E2 instead of having it be
limited to the capabilities of the E1x. But as far as we can tell, the
array ""stats_query_entry query"" was still limited to using the FP-SB
available to the E1x cards as part of an oversignt when the driver was
updated to take full advantage of the E2, and now with the driver being
aware of the greater queue size supported by E2 NICs, it causes the UBSAN
warnings seen in the stack traces below.

This patch increases the size of the ""stats_query_entry query"" array by
replacing FP_SB_MAX_E1x with FP_SB_MAX_E2 to be large enough to handle
both types of NICs.

CVE-2024-42149,0,"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

fs: don't misleadingly warn during thaw operations

The block device may have been frozen before it was claimed by a
filesystem. Concurrently another process might try to mount that
frozen block device and has temporarily claimed the block device for
that purpose causing a concurrent fs_bdev_thaw() to end up here. The
mounter is already about to abort mounting because they still saw an
elevanted bdev->bd_fsfreeze_count so get_bdev_super() will return
NULL in that case.

For example, P1 calls dm_suspend() which calls into bdev_freeze() before
the block device has been claimed by the filesystem. This brings
bdev->bd_fsfreeze_count to 1 and no call into fs_bdev_freeze() is
required.

Now P2 tries to mount that frozen block device. It claims it and checks
bdev->bd_fsfreeze_count. As it's elevated it aborts mounting.

In the meantime P3 called dm_resume(). P3 sees that the block device is
already claimed by a filesystem and calls into fs_bdev_thaw().

P3 takes a passive reference and realizes that the filesystem isn't
ready yet. P3 puts itself to sleep to wait for the filesystem to become
ready.

P2 now puts the last active reference to the filesystem and marks it as
dying. P3 gets woken, sees that the filesystem is dying and

empty.  However, it is not the correct check as the implementation of
list_first_entry is not designed to return NULL for empty lists.

Instead, use list_first_entry_or_null() which does return NULL if the
list is empty.

btrfs: zoned: fix calc_available_free_space() for zoned mode

calc_available_free_space() returns the total size of metadata (or
system) block groups, which can be allocated from unallocated disk
space. The logic is wrong on zoned mode in two places.

First, the calculation of data_chunk_size is wrong. We always allocate
one zone as one chunk, and no partial allocation of a zone. So, we
should use zone_size (= data_sinfo->chunk_size) as it is.

Second, the result ""avail"" may not be zone aligned. Since we always
allocate one zone as one chunk on zoned mode, returning non-zone size
aligned bytes will result in less pressure on the async metadata reclaim
process.

This is serious for the nearly full state with a large zone size device.
Allowing over-commit too much will result in less async reclaim work and
end up in ENOSPC. We can align down to the zone size to avoid that.",1.258305889

CVE-2024-23657,8.8,"Nuxt is a free and open-source framework to create full-stack web applications and websites with Vue.js. Nuxt Devtools is missing authentication on the `getTextAssetContent` RPC function which is vulnerable to path traversal.  Combined with a lack of Origin checks on the WebSocket handler,  an attacker is able to interact with a locally running devtools instance and exfiltrate data abusing this vulnerability. In certain configurations an attacker could leak the devtools authentication token and then abuse other RPC functions to achieve RCE. The `getTextAssetContent` function does not check for path traversals, this could allow an attacker to read arbitrary files over the RPC WebSocket. The WebSocket server does not check the origin of the request leading to cross-site-websocket-hijacking. This may be intentional to allow certain configurations to work correctly. Nuxt Devtools authentication tokens are placed within the home directory of the current user. The malicious webpage can connect to the Devtools WebSocket, perform a directory traversal brute force to find the authentication token, then use the *authenticated* `writeStaticAssets` function to create a new Component, Nitro Handler or `app.vue` file which will run automatically as the file is changed. This vulnerability has been addressed in release version 1.3.9. All users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.",1.356392434
CVE-2024-34343,6.3,"Nuxt is a free and open-source framework to create full-stack web applications and websites with Vue.js. The `navigateTo` function attempts to blockthe `javascript:` protocol, but does not correctly use API's provided by `unjs/ufo`. This library also contains parsing discrepancies.  The function first tests to see if the specified URL has a protocol. This uses the unjs/ufo package for URL parsing. This function works effectively, and returns true for a javascript: protocol. After this, the URL is parsed using the parseURL function. This function will refuse to parse poorly formatted URLs. Parsing javascript:alert(1) returns null/"""" for all values. Next, the protocol of the URL is then checked using the isScriptProtocol function. This function simply checks the input against a list of protocols, and does not perform any parsing. The combination of refusing to parse poorly formatted URLs, and not performing additional parsing means that script checks fail as no protocol can be found. Even if a protocol was identified, whitespace is not stripped in the parseURL implementation, bypassing the isScriptProtocol checks. Certain special protocols are identified at the top of parseURL. Inserting a newline or tab into this sequence will block the special protocol check, and bypass the latter checks. This ONLY has impact after SSR has occured, the `javascript:` protocol within a location header does not trigger XSS.

This endpoint is at `/api/_nuxt_icon/[name]`. The proxied request path is improperly parsed, allowing an attacker to change the scheme and host of the request. This leads to SSRF, and could potentially lead to sensitive data exposure. The `new URL` constructor is used to parse the final path. This constructor can be passed a relative scheme or path in order to change the host the request is sent to. This constructor is also very tolerant of poorly formatted URLs. As a result we can pass a path prefixed with the string `http:`. This has the effect of changing the scheme to HTTP. We can then subsequently pass a new host, for example `http:127.0.0.1:8080`. This would allow us to send requests to a local server. This issue has been addressed in release version 1.4.5 and all users are advised to upgrade.

CVE-2024-42358,5.5,"PDFio is a simple C library for reading and writing PDF files. There is a denial of service (DOS) vulnerability in the TTF parser. Maliciously crafted TTF files can cause the program to utilize 100% of the Memory and enter an infinite loop. This can also lead to a heap-buffer-overflow vulnerability. An infinite loop occurs in the read_camp function by nGroups value. The ttf.h library is vulnerable. A value called nGroups is extracted from the file, and by changing that value, you can cause the program to utilize 100% of the Memory and enter an infinite loop. If the value of nGroups in the file is small, an infinite loop will not occur. This library, whether used as a standalone binary or as part of another application, is vulnerable to DOS attacks when parsing certain types of files. Automated systems, including web servers that use this code to convert PDF submissions into plaintext, can be DOSed if an attacker uploads a malicious TTF file.

libceph: fix race between delayed_work() and ceph_monc_stop()

The way the delayed work is handled in ceph_monc_stop() is prone to
races with mon_fault() and possibly also finish_hunting().  Both of
these can requeue the delayed work which wouldn't be canceled by any of
the following code in case that happens after cancel_delayed_work_sync()
runs -- __close_session() doesn't mess with the delayed work in order
to avoid interfering with the hunting interval logic.  This part was

that hang off of it, with monc->auth and monc->monmap being
particularly susceptible to quickly being reused.

- clear monc->cur_mon and monc->hunting as part of closing the session
  in ceph_monc_stop()
- bail from delayed_work() if monc->cur_mon is cleared, similar to how
  it's done in mon_fault() and finish_hunting() (based on monc->hunting)

mm: fix crashes from deferred split racing folio migration

Even on 6.10-rc6, I've been seeing elusive ""Bad page state""s (often on
flags when freeing, yet the flags shown are not bad: PG_locked had been
set and cleared??), and VM_BUG_ON_PAGE(page_ref_count(page) == 0)s from
deferred_split_scan()'s folio_put(), and a variety of other BUG and WARN
symptoms implying double free by deferred split and large folio migration.

6.7 commit 9bcef5973e31 (""mm: memcg: fix split queue list crash when large
folio migration"") was right to fix the memcg-dependent locking broken in
85ce2c517ade (""memcontrol: only transfer the memcg data for migration""),
but missed a subtlety of deferred_split_scan(): it moves folios to its own
local list to work on them without split_queue_lock, during which time
folio->_deferred_list is not empty, but even the ""right"" lock does nothing
to secure the folio and the list it is on.

Fortunately, deferred_split_scan() is careful to use folio_try_get(): so
folio_migrate_mapping() can avoid the race by folio_undo_large_rmappable()
while the old folio's reference count is temporarily frozen to 0 - adding
such a freeze in the !mapping case too (originally, folio lock and
unmapping and no swap cache left an anon folio unreachable, so no freezing
was needed there: but the deferred split queue offers a way to reach it).",1.033695637

CVE-2024-42239,5.5,"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

bpf: Fail bpf_timer_cancel when callback is being cancelled

Given a schedule:

timer1 cb			timer2 cb

bpf_timer_cancel(timer2);	bpf_timer_cancel(timer1);

Both bpf_timer_cancel calls would wait for the other callback to finish
executing, introducing a lockup.

Add an atomic_t count named 'cancelling' in bpf_hrtimer. This keeps
track of all in-flight cancellation requests for a given BPF timer.
Whenever cancelling a BPF timer, we must check if we have outstanding
cancellation requests, and if so, we must fail the operation with an
error (-EDEADLK) since cancellation is synchronous and waits for the
callback to finish executing. This implies that we can enter a deadlock
situation involving two or more timer callbacks executing in parallel
and attempting to cancel one another.

Note that we avoid incrementing the cancelling counter for the target
timer (the one being cancelled) if bpf_timer_cancel is not invoked from
a callback, to avoid spurious errors. The whole point of detecting
cur->cancelling and returning -EDEADLK is to not enter a busy wait loop
(which may or may not lead to a lockup). This does not apply in case the
caller is in a non-callback context, the other side can continue to
cancel as it sees fit without running into errors.

Background on prior attempts:

Earlier versions of this patch used a bool 'cancelling' bit and used the
following pattern under timer->lock to publish cancellation status.

lock(t->lock);
t->cancelling = true;
mb();
if (cur->cancelling)
	return -EDEADLK;
unlock(t->lock);
hrtimer_cancel(t->timer);
t->cancelling = false;

The store outside the critical section could overwrite a parallel
requests t->cancelling assignment to true, to ensure the parallely
executing callback observes its cancellation status.

It would be necessary to clear this cancelling bit once hrtimer_cancel
is done, but lack of serialization introduced races. Another option was
explored where bpf_timer_start would clear the bit when (re)starting the
timer under timer->lock. This would ensure serialized access to the
cancelling bit, but may allow it to be cleared before in-flight
hrtimer_cancel has finished executing, such that lockups can occur
again.

Thus, we choose an atomic counter to keep track of all outstanding
cancellation requests and use it to prevent lockups in case callbacks
attempt to cancel each other while executing in parallel.",1.222856001

x86/bhi: Avoid warning in #DB handler due to BHI mitigation

When BHI mitigation is enabled, if SYSENTER is invoked with the TF flag set
then entry_SYSENTER_compat() uses CLEAR_BRANCH_HISTORY and calls the
clear_bhb_loop() before the TF flag is cleared. This causes the #DB handler
(exc_debug_kernel()) to issue a warning because single-step is used outside the
entry_SYSENTER_compat() function.

To address this issue, entry_SYSENTER_compat() should use CLEAR_BRANCH_HISTORY
after making sure the TF flag is cleared.

The problem can be reproduced with the following sequence:

  $ cat sysenter_step.c
  int main()
  { asm(""pushf; pop %ax; bts $8,%ax; push %ax; popf; sysenter""); }

  $ gcc -o sysenter_step sysenter_step.c

  $ ./sysenter_step
  Segmentation fault (core dumped)

Fix it by disabling PMD-sized page cache when HPAGE_PMD_ORDER is larger
than MAX_PAGECACHE_ORDER.  As Matthew Wilcox pointed, the page cache in a
shmem file isn't represented by a multi-index entry and doesn't have this
limitation when the xarry entry is split until commit 6b24ca4a1a8d (""mm:
Use multi-index entries in the page cache"").",1.458146242

CVE-2024-42244,5.5,"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

USB: serial: mos7840: fix crash on resume

Since commit c49cfa917025 (""USB: serial: use generic method if no
alternative is provided in usb serial layer""), USB serial core calls the
generic resume implementation when the driver has not provided one.

This can trigger a crash on resume with mos7840 since support for
multiple read URBs was added back in 2011. Specifically, both port read
URBs are now submitted on resume for open ports, but the context pointer
of the second URB is left set to the core rather than mos7840 port
structure.

Fix this by implementing dedicated suspend and resume functions for
mos7840.

Tested with Delock 87414 USB 2.0 to 4x serial adapter.

Revert ""sched/fair: Make sure to try to detach at least one movable task""

This reverts commit b0defa7ae03ecf91b8bfd10ede430cff12fcbd06.

b0defa7ae03ec changed the load balancing logic to ignore env.max_loop if
all tasks examined to that point were pinned. The goal of the patch was
to make it more likely to be able to detach a task buried in a long list
of pinned tasks. However, this has the unfortunate side effect of
creating an O(n) iteration in detach_tasks(), as we now must fully
iterate every task on a cpu if all or most are pinned. Since this load
balance code is done with rq lock held, and often in softirq context, it
is very easy to trigger hard lockups. We observed such hard lockups with
a user who affined O(10k) threads to a single cpu.

When I discussed this with Vincent he initially suggested that we keep
the limit on the number of tasks to detach, but increase the number of
tasks we can search. However, after some back and forth on the mailing
list, he recommended we instead revert the original patch, as it seems
likely no one was actually getting hit by the original issue.",1.473343055

net, sunrpc: Remap EPERM in case of connection failure in xs_tcp_setup_socket

When using a BPF program on kernel_connect(), the call can return -EPERM. This

the kernel to potentially freeze up.

Neil suggested:

  This will propagate -EPERM up into other layers which might not be ready
  to handle it. It might be safer to map EPERM to an error we would be more
  likely to expect from the network system - such as ECONNREFUSED or ENETDOWN.

ECONNREFUSED as error seems reasonable. For programs setting a different error
can be out of reach (see handling in 4fbac77d2d09) in particular on kernels
which do not have f10d05966196 (""bpf: Make BPF_PROG_RUN_ARRAY return -err

CVE-2024-42256,0,"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

cifs: Fix server re-repick on subrequest retry

When a subrequest is marked for needing retry, netfs will call
cifs_prepare_write() which will make cifs repick the server for the op
before renegotiating credits; it then calls cifs_issue_write() which
invokes smb2_async_writev() - which re-repicks the server.

If a different server is then selected, this causes the increment of
server->in_flight to happen against one record and the decrement to happen
against another, leading to misaccounting.

Fix this by just removing the repick code in smb2_async_writev().  As this
is only called from netfslib-driven code, cifs_prepare_write() should
always have been called first, and so server should never be NULL and the
preparatory step is repeated in the event that we do a retry.

The problem manifests as a warning looking something like:

CVE-2024-42467,10,"openHAB, a provider of open-source home automation software, has add-ons including the visualization add-on CometVisu. Prior to version 4.2.1, the proxy endpoint of openHAB's CometVisu add-on can be accessed without authentication. This proxy-feature can be exploited as Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) to induce GET HTTP requests to internal-only servers, in case openHAB is exposed in a non-private network. Furthermore, this proxy-feature can also be exploited as a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability, as an attacker is able to re-route a request to their server and return a page with malicious JavaScript code. Since the browser receives this data directly from the openHAB CometVisu UI, this JavaScript code will be executed with the origin of the CometVisu UI. This allows an attacker to exploit call endpoints on an openHAB server even if the openHAB server is located in a private network. (e.g. by sending an openHAB admin a link that proxies malicious JavaScript.) This issue may lead up to Remote Code Execution (RCE) when chained with other vulnerabilities.

There are no workarounds to mitigate these\nvulnerabilities other than disabling H.323 on the vulnerable device. \n\nThis advisory is posted at \nhttp://www.cisco.com/warp/public/707/cisco-sa-20100922-h323.shtml\n\nNote:  The September 22, 2010, Cisco IOS Software Security Advisory\nbundled publication includes six Cisco Security Advisories. Five of\nthe advisories address vulnerabilities in Cisco IOS Software, and one\nadvisory addresses vulnerabilities in Cisco Unified Communications\nManager. Each advisory lists the releases that correct the\nvulnerability or vulnerabilities detailed in the advisory. The table\nat the following URL lists releases that correct all Cisco IOS\nSoftware vulnerabilities that have been published on September 22,\n2010, or earlier:\n\nhttp://www.cisco.com/warp/public/707/cisco-sa-20100922-bundle.shtml\n\nIndividual publication links are in ""Cisco Event Response: Semiannual\nCisco IOS Software Security Advisory Bundled Publication"" at the\nfollowing link:\n\nhttp://www.cisco.com/web/about/security/intelligence/Cisco_ERP_sep10.html\n\nAffected Products\n=================\n\nThese vulnerabilities only affect devices that are running Cisco IOS\nSoftware with H.323 voice services enabled. \n\nVulnerable Products\n+------------------\n\nCisco devices that are running affected Cisco IOS Software versions\nthat are configured to process H.323 messages are affected by these\nvulnerabilities. H.323 is not enabled by default. \n\nTo determine if the Cisco IOS Software device is running H.323\nservices, issue the show process cpu | include H323 command, as shown\nin this example:\n\n    Router# show process cpu | include H323\n     249       16000           3       5333  0.00%  0.00%  0.00%   0 CCH323_CT\n     250           0           1          0  0.00%  0.00%  0.00%   0 CCH323_DNS\n    Router#\n\nIn the previous example the processes CCH323_CT and CCH323_DNS are\nrunning on the device; therefore, the device is listening to H.323\nmessages. The device is vulnerable if any of these processes (or\nsimilar) are active. \n\nNote: Creating a dial peer by issuing the dial-peer voice command\nwill start the H.323 processes, which causes the Cisco IOS device to\nprocess H.323 messages. \n\nTo determine the Cisco IOS Software release that is running on a\nCisco product, administrators can log in to the device and issue the\nshow version command to display the system banner. The system banner\nconfirms that the device is running Cisco IOS Software by displaying\ntext similar to ""Cisco Internetwork Operating System Software"" or\n""Cisco IOS Software."" The image name displays in parentheses,\nfollowed by ""Version"" and the Cisco IOS Software release name. Other\nCisco devices do not have the show version command or may provide\ndifferent output. \n\nThe following example identifies a Cisco product that is running\nCisco IOS Software Release 12.3(26) with an installed image name of\nC2500-IS-L:\n\n    Router# show version\n    Cisco Internetwork Operating System Software\n    IOS (tm) 2500 Software (C2500-IS-L), Version 12.3(26), RELEASE SOFTWARE (fc2)\n    Technical Support: http://www.cisco.com/techsupport\n    Copyright (c) 1986-2008 by cisco Systems, Inc. \n    Compiled Mon 17-Mar-08 14:39 by dchih\n\n\n    !--- output truncated\n\n\nThe following example identifies a Cisco product that is running\nCisco IOS Software Release 12.4(20)T with an installed image name of\nC1841-ADVENTERPRISEK9-M:\n\n    Router# show version\n    Cisco IOS Software, 1841 Software (C1841-ADVENTERPRISEK9-M), Version 12.4(20)T,\n        RELEASE SOFTWARE (fc3)\n    Technical Support: http://www.cisco.com/techsupport\n    Copyright (c) 1986-2008 by Cisco Systems, Inc. \n    Compiled Thu 10-Jul-08 20:25 by prod_rel_team\n\n\n    !--- output truncated\n\n\nAdditional information about Cisco IOS Software release naming\nconventions is available in ""White Paper: Cisco IOS Reference Guide""\nat the following link: \nhttp://www.cisco.com/web/about/security/intelligence/ios-ref.html\n\nProducts Confirmed Not Vulnerable\n+--------------------------------\n\nCisco IOS XR Software is not affected by these vulnerabilities. \n\nNo other Cisco products are currently known to be affected by these\nvulnerabilities. \n\nDetails\n=======\n\nH.323 is the International Telecommunication Union (ITU) standard for\nreal-time multimedia communications and conferencing over\npacket-based (IP) networks. A subset of the H.323 standard is\nH.225.0, a standard that is used for call signaling protocols and\nmedia stream packetization over IP networks. An attacker can exploit these vulnerabilities\nremotely by sending crafted H.323 packets to an affected device that\nis running Cisco IOS Software. A TCP three-way handshake is required\nto exploit these vulnerabilities. \n\nThese vulnerabilities are documented in Cisco Bug IDs CSCtc73759 (\nregistered customers only) and CSCtd33567 ( registered customers\nonly) , and have been assigned Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures\n(CVE) IDs CVE-2010-2828 and CVE-2010-2829, respectively. \n\nVulnerability Scoring Details\n=============================\n\nCisco has provided scores for the vulnerabilities in this advisory\nbased on the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS). The CVSS\nscoring in this Security Advisory is done in accordance with CVSS\nversion 2.0. \n\nCVSS is a standards-based scoring method that conveys vulnerability\nseverity and helps determine urgency and priority of response. \n\nCisco has provided a base and temporal score. Customers can then\ncompute environmental scores to assist in determining the impact of\nthe vulnerability in individual networks. \n\nCisco has provided an FAQ to answer additional questions regarding\nCVSS at\n\nhttp://www.cisco.com/web/about/security/intelligence/cvss-qandas.html\n\nCisco has also provided a CVSS calculator to help compute the\nenvironmental impact for individual networks at\n\nhttp://intellishield.cisco.com/security/alertmanager/cvss\n\nCSCtc73759 - Device crashing upon receipt of specific traffic\n\nCVSS Base Score - 7.8\nAccess Vector           Network\nAccess Complexity       Low\nAuthentication          None\nConfidentiality Impact  None\nIntegrity Impact        None\nAvailability Impact     Complete\n\nCVSS Temporal Score - 6.4\nExploitability          Functional\nRemediation Level       Official Fix\nReport Confidence       Confirmed\n\nCSCtd33567 - Traceback seen when receiving crafted H.323 packets\n\nCVSS Base Score - 7.8\nAccess Vector           Network\nAccess Complexity       Low\nAuthentication          None\nConfidentiality Impact  None\nIntegrity Impact        None\nAvailability Impact     Complete\n\nCVSS Temporal Score - 6.4\nExploitability          Functional\nRemediation Level       Official Fix\nReport Confidence       Confirmed\n\nImpact\n======\n\nSuccessful exploitation of the vulnerabilities described in this\nadvisory may cause the affected device to reload. Theses\nvulnerabilities could be exploited repeatedly to cause an extended\nDoS condition. \n\nSoftware Versions and Fixes\n===========================\n\nWhen considering software upgrades, also consult \nhttp://www.cisco.com/go/psirt and any subsequent advisories to \ndetermine exposure and a complete upgrade solution. \n\nIn all cases, customers should exercise caution to be certain the\ndevices to be upgraded contain sufficient memory and that current\nhardware and software configurations will continue to be supported\nproperly by the new release. If the information is not clear, contact\nthe Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or your contracted\nmaintenance provider for assistance. \n\nEach row of the following Cisco IOS Software table corresponds to a\nCisco IOS Software train. If a particular train is vulnerable, the\nearliest releases that contain the fix are listed in the First Fixed\nRelease For This Advisory column.

Cisco has released free software updates that address this\nvulnerability. \n\nThis advisory is posted at \nhttp://www.cisco.com/warp/public/707/cisco-sa-20100922-igmp.shtml\n\nNote: The September 22, 2010, Cisco IOS Software Security Advisory\nbundled publication includes six Cisco Security Advisories. Five of\nthe advisories address vulnerabilities in Cisco IOS Software, and one\nadvisory addresses vulnerabilities in Cisco Unified Communications\nManager. Each advisory lists the releases that correct the\nvulnerability or vulnerabilities detailed in the advisory. The table\nat the following URL lists releases that correct all Cisco IOS\nSoftware vulnerabilities that have been published on September 22,\n2010, or earlier:\n\nhttp://www.cisco.com/warp/public/707/cisco-sa-20100922-bundle.shtml\n\nIndividual publication links are in ""Cisco Event Response: Semiannual\nCisco IOS Software Security Advisory Bundled Publication"" at the\nfollowing link:\n\nhttp://www.cisco.com/web/about/security/intelligence/Cisco_ERP_sep10.html\n\nAffected Products\n=================\n\nVulnerable Products\n+------------------\n\nThe following products are affected by this vulnerability:\n\n  * Cisco IOS Software\n  * Cisco IOS XE Software\n    To determine the Cisco IOS Software release that is running on a\n    Cisco product, administrators can log in to the device and issue\n    the show version command to display the system banner. The system\n    banner confirms that the device is running Cisco IOS Software by\n    displaying text similar to ""Cisco Internetwork Operating System\n    Software"" or ""Cisco IOS Software."" The image name displays in\n    parentheses, followed by ""Version"" and the Cisco IOS Software\n    release name. Other Cisco devices do not have the show version\n    command or may provide different output. \n    The following example identifies a Cisco product that is running\n    Cisco IOS Software Release 12.4(20)T with an installed image name\n    of C1841-ADVENTERPRISEK9-M:\n\n        Router#show version\n        Cisco IOS Software, 1841 Software (C1841-ADVENTERPRISEK9-M), Version 12.4(20)T, RELEASE SOFTWARE (fc3)\n        Technical Support: http://www.cisco.com/techsupport\n        Copyright (c) 1986-2008 by Cisco Systems, Inc. \n        Compiled Thu 10-Jul-08 20:25 by prod_rel_team\n\n    Additional information about Cisco IOS Software release naming\n    conventions is available in White Paper: Cisco IOS and NX-OS\n    Software Reference Guide. \n\nProducts Confirmed Not Vulnerable\n+--------------------------------\n\nNo other Cisco products are currently known to be affected by this\nvulnerability. \n\nThe IGMP version 1, IGMP version 2, and IPv6 Multicast Listener\nDiscovery protocol (MLD) features in Cisco IOS and Cisco IOS XE\nSoftware are not affected by this vulnerability. \n\nDetails\n=======\n\nInternet Group Management Protocol (IGMP) is the protocol used by\nhosts and adjacent routers to manage membership in IP multicast\ngroups. The IGMP version 3 protocol permits source-specific multicast\nwhich allows hosts to specify the IP address of the multicast source. \n\nA malformed IGMP packet can cause a vulnerable device to reload. This\nvulnerability can only be exploited if the malformed IGMP packet is\nreceived on an interface that has been enabled for IGMP version 3 and\nProtocol Independent Multicast (PIM). The malformed IGMP packet\ndestination address can be unicast, multicast, or broadcast and can\nbe addressed to any IP address in the vulnerable device, including\nloopback addresses. \n\nTo exploit this vulnerability, a malformed packet must be received on\na vulnerable interface, but it can be addressed to any IP address on\nthe vulnerable device. \n\nTransit traffic will not trigger this vulnerability. \n\nA vulnerable interface configuration requires the PIM mode of\noperation (sparse-dense, sparse, or dense) to be configured in\naddition to the ip igmp version 3 command. The three possible\nconfigurations that permit exploitation of this vulnerability are:\n\n\n    !--- Interface configured for PIM sparse and IGMPv3\n\n\n    interface GigabitEthernet0/0\n     ip address 192.168.0.1 255.255.255.0\n     ip pim sparse-mode\n     ip igmp version 3\n\n\n    !--- Interface configured for PIM sparse-dense and IGMPv3\n\n\n    interface GigabitEthernet0/1\n     ip address 192.168.1.1 255.255.255.0\n     ip pim sparse-dense-mode\n     ip igmp version 3\n\n\n    !--- Interface configured for PIM dense and IGMPv3\n\n\n    interface GigabitEthernet0/2\n     ip address 192.168.2.1 255.255.255.0\n     ip pim dense-mode\n     ip igmp version 3\n\nThe IGMP version 3 lite feature is unrelated to this vulnerability,\nin that the presence or absence of the ip igmp v3lite command on an\ninterface does not change the vulnerable condition of that interface. \n\nThe IP router alert option may or may not be present in packets\nattempting to exploit the vulnerability described in this document. This vulnerability has been assigned\nCommon Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) ID CVE-2010-2830. \n\nVulnerability Scoring Details\n=============================\n\nCisco has provided scores for the vulnerability in this advisory\nbased on the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS). The CVSS\nscoring in this Security Advisory is done in accordance with CVSS\nversion 2.0. \n\nCVSS is a standards-based scoring method that conveys vulnerability\nseverity and helps determine urgency and priority of response. \n\nCisco has provided a base and temporal score. Customers can then\ncompute environmental scores to assist in determining the impact of\nthe vulnerability in individual networks. \n\nCisco has provided an FAQ to answer additional questions regarding\nCVSS at\n\nhttp://www.cisco.com/web/about/security/intelligence/cvss-qandas.html\n\nCisco has also provided a CVSS calculator to help compute the\nenvironmental impact for individual networks at\n\nhttp://intellishield.cisco.com/security/alertmanager/cvss\n\nCSCte14603 - IGMPv3 DoS Vulnerability\n\nCVSS Base Score - 7.1\nAccess Vector           Network\nAccess Complexity       Medium\nAuthentication          None\nConfidentiality Impact  None\nIntegrity Impact        None\nAvailability Impact     Complete\n\nCVSS Temporal Score - 5.9\nExploitability          Functional\nRemediation Level       Official Fix\nReport Confidence       Confirmed\n\nImpact\n======\n\nSuccessful exploitation of this vulnerability may cause the affected\ndevice vulnerable device to reload. Repeated exploitation may result\nin a sustained DoS condition. \n\nSoftware Versions and Fixes\n===========================\n\nWhen considering software upgrades, also consult \nhttp://www.cisco.com/go/psirt and any subsequent advisories to \ndetermine exposure and a complete upgrade solution. \n\nIn all cases, customers should exercise caution to be certain the\ndevices to be upgraded contain sufficient memory and that current\nhardware and software configurations will continue to be supported\nproperly by the new release. If the information is not clear, contact\nthe Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or your contracted\nmaintenance provider for assistance. \n\nEach row of the following Cisco IOS Software table corresponds to a\nCisco IOS Software train. If a particular train is vulnerable, the\nearliest releases that contain the fix are listed in the First Fixed\nRelease For This Advisory column. The First Fixed Release for All\nAdvisories in the September 2010 Bundle Publication column lists the\nearliest possible releases that correct all the published\nvulnerabilities in the Cisco IOS Software Security Advisory bundled\npublication. Cisco recommends upgrading to the latest available\nrelease, where possible. \n\n+-------------------------------------------------------------------+\n|   Major    |          Availability of Repaired Releases           |\n|  Release   |                                                      |\n|------------+------------------------------------------------------|\n|  Affected  |                          |  First Fixed Release for  |\n| 12.0-Based | First Fixed Release for  |   All Advisories in the   |\n|  Releases  |      This Advisory       |   September 2010 Bundle   |\n|            |                          |        Publication        |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| There are no affected 12.0 based releases                         |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------------|\n|  Affected  |                          |  First Fixed Release for  |\n| 12.1-Based | First Fixed Release for  |   All Advisories in the   |\n|  Releases  |      This Advisory       |   September 2010 Bundle   |\n|            |                          |        Publication        |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| There are no affected 12.1 based releases                         |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------------|\n|  Affected  |                          |  First Fixed Release for  |\n| 12.2-Based | First Fixed Release for  |   All Advisories in the   |\n|  Releases  |      This Advisory       |   September 2010 Bundle   |\n|            |                          |        Publication        |\n|------------+--------------------------+---------------------------|\n| 12.2       | Not Vulnerable           | Vulnerable;

Exposure:      Passwords are stored as plain text in config files\n6. Vulnerability: Bad permissions on /etc/shadow\n\n\n\n1. Vulnerability: Authentication Bypass by SQL-Injection\n                  (CVE-2013-5945)\n\n\n* Possible via the global webUI login form. \n\n* File /pfrm2.0/share/lua/5.1/teamf1lualib/login.lua contains:\n\n  function login.authenticate(tablename, tableInput)\n    local username = tableInput[""Users.UserName""]\n    local password = tableInput[""Users.Password""]\n    local cur = db.execute(string.format([[\n                  SELECT *, ROWID AS _ROWID_ FROM %s\n          WHERE %s = \'%s\' AND %s = \'%s\'\n      ]], tablename, ""UserName"", username, ""Password"", password))\n    local result = false\n    local statusCode = ""NONE""\n    if cur then\n      local row = cur:fetch({}, ""a"")\n      cur:close()\n      result = row ~= nil\n      if result == false then\n        statusCode = ""USER_LOGIN_INVALID_PASSWORD""\n      end\n    end\n    return result, statusCode\n  end\n\n* This function creates an SQL statement of the form:\n\n  SELECT * FROM ""Users"" WHERE ""UserName"" = \'user\' AND ""Password"" = \'pass\';\n\n* Since there is a default admin user account called ""admin"" around, this is \n  easily exploitable by providing this to the login form:\n\n  username = admin\n  password = \' or \'a\'=\'a\n\n* ...resulting in this SQL statement:\n\n  SELECT * \n    FROM ""Users"" \n    WHERE ""UserName"" = \'admin\' \n      AND ""Password"" = \'\' or \'a\'=\'a\';\n\n* Old school SQL injection. Ohh, by the way... \n\n* The same fault can be found in captivePortal.lua \n  -- FREE NETWORKS FOR EVERYONE --\n\n\n\n2. \n\n* File /pfrm2.0/var/www/systemCheck.htm contains:\n\n  local function runShellCmd(command)\n      local pipe = io.popen(command .. "" 2>&1"") -- redirect stderr to stdout\n      local cmdOutput = pipe:read(""*a"")\n      pipe:close()\n      return cmdOutput\n  end\n  if (ButtonType and ButtonType == ""ping"") then\n  [...]\n  local cmd_ping = pingprog ..

Tools like curl are not hindered by these checks. \n  \n* All forms allow input like this:\n  \n  localhost;<command>\n  \n  example: \n  \n  localhost;cat /etc/passwd\n  \n* This user provided value is then directly used as part of the input for the\n  call to runShellCmd(c) and thus io.popen(c) in the first form section and \n  os.execute(c) in the second form section. \n  \n* Output from user provided commands gets displayed on the next page beneath \n  the benign command output. \n  \n  example: \n  \n  [...]\n  <textarea rows=""15"" name=""S1"" cols=""60"" wrap=""off"" class=""txtbox1"">\n    traceroute to localhost (127.0.0.1), 10 hops max, 40 byte packets\n     1  localhost (127.0.0.1)  0.429 ms  0.255 ms  0.224 ms\n    root:!:0:0:root:/root:/bin/sh\n    gkJ9232xXyruTRmY:$1$MqlhcYXP$CC3cvqpCg0RJAzV85LSeO0:0:0:root:/:/bin/sh\n    nobody:x:0:0:nobody:/nonexistent:/bin/false\n    ZX4q9Q9JUpwTZuo7:x:0:2:Linux User,,,:/home/ZX4q9Q9JUpwTZuo7:/bin/sh\n    guest:x:0:1001:Linux User,,,:/home/guest:/bin/sh\n    admin:x:0:2:Linux User,,,:/home/admin:/bin/sh\n  &lt;/textarea&gt;\n  [...]\n  \n  \n  \n3. Exposure: D-Link backdoor user:\n  \n  \n* This was the contents of my /etc/passwd after I upgraded to 1.08B39_WW:\n\n  root:!:0:0:root:/root:/bin/sh\n  gkJ9232xXyruTRmY:$1$MqlhcYXP$CC3cvqpCg0RJAzV85LSeO0:0:0:root:/:/bin/sh\n  nobody:x:0:0:nobody:/nonexistent:/bin/false\n  ZX4q9Q9JUpwTZuo7:x:0:2:Linux User,,,:/home/ZX4q9Q9JUpwTZuo7:/bin/sh\n  guest:x:0:1001:Linux User,,,:/home/guest:/bin/sh\n  admin:x:0:2:Linux User,,,:/home/admin:/bin/sh\n\n* You can see the old D-Link backdoor user name ""ZX4q9Q9JUpwTZuo7"". \n  That was the account I hacked before with my previous exploit: \n  http://www.exploit-db.com/papers/22930/\n  And there is a new backdoor user ""gkJ9232xXyruTRmY"" introduced. \n  Instead of removing the backdoor, D-Link just created a new one. \n  \n* I verified this by showing the /etc/profile:\n  \n  # /etc/profile\n  LD_LIBRARY_PATH=.:/pfrm2.0/lib:/lib\n  PATH=.:/pfrm2.0/bin:$PATH\n  CLISH_PATH=/etc/clish\n  export PATH LD_LIBRARY_PATH CLISH_PATH\n  # redirect all users except root to CLI\n  if [ ""$USER"" != ""gkJ9232xXyruTRmY"" ] ; then\n  trap ""/bin/login"" SIGINT\n  trap """" SIGTSTP\n  /pfrm2.0/bin/cli\n  exit\n  fi\n  PS1=\'DSR-250N> \'\n  \n  \n  \n4. Vulnerability: Use of weak hash algorithms:\n\n\n* In the /etc/shadow, salted DES hashes are used to store user passwords. \n  Since this hash type supports at most 8 characters, users can log in by just \n  typing the first 8 letters of their passwords when using SSH or telnet. \n  \n* An effective password length limitation of 8 characters makes brute force \n  attacks on user accounts very feasible, even if the user chose a longer \n  password. \n\n\n\n5.

VAR-201401-0557,0,"{'_id': None, 'data': ""Buffer overflow in the INetViewX ActiveX control in the Lorex Edge LH310 and Edge+ LH320 series with firmware 7-35-28-1B26E, Edge2 LH330 series with firmware 11.17.38-33_1D97A, and Edge3 LH340 series with firmware 11.19.85_1FE3A allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (crash) and possibly execute arbitrary code via a long string in the HTTP_PORT parameter. Lorex Security DVR Edge Series is the Edge series of digital video recorder products from Lorex Technologies of the United States. A remote buffer overflow vulnerability exists in Lorex Security DVR Edge Series. Failed exploit attempts will result in a denial-of-service condition. Hi,\n\nI have discovered a buffer overflow vulnerability that allows remote code\nexecution in an ActiveX control bundled by a manufacturer of video\nsurveillance systems. \nThe company is Lorex Technologies, a major video surveillance manufacturer\nthat is very popular in the US and East Asia. I have confirmed that all\n16 are vulnerable at this point in time. The\nLorex manual[1] instructs the user to blindly accept the ActiveX control\ninstall when prompted. \nThe full list of devices, as well as links to the firware download, can be\nfound in [2]. Their products offer remote video viewing capabilities, and\nyou can find some of them on Shodan[3]. \n\nThe buffer overflow can be triggered by a really long string (10000+\ncharacters) in the HTTP_PORT parameter. The instruction pointer can be very\neasily controlled in XP by the characters 109 to 113 in the string. Please\nrefer to the PoC file lorex-testcase.html. You will see that the HTTP_PORT\nparameter is composed of D's, apart from chars 109 to 113 which are four\nA's. If you open this file in IE after installing the control, you will see\nthat IE will crash with an EIP of 0x41414141. Changing the four A's to any\nother value will cause EIP to crash on that value. \n\nThe list below tells a better story about what is affected and how it can\nbe controlled:\nWin XP SP3 with IE6 - Fully exploitable as described\nWin XP SP3 with IE8 - Could not get it to crash (????)\nWin 7 x64 with IE10 fully patched - Fully exploitable, though not as easy\nas for XP (see analyze -v [4] and !exploitable [5] outputs)\n\nTo verify this vulnerability you can download and extract the firmware\nusing binwalk (http://code.google.com/p/binwalk/). To do so, please follow\nthe instructions in [6], and then install the ActiveX control in\nINetViewProj1_02030330.cab. \n\nI have contacted Lorex and they initially said they would fix it, but went\nradio silent shortly afterwards. \n17.11.2013 - Initial contact via support page\n18.11.2013 - Email to sales, no response. \n21.11.2013 - Second email to sales, received response by sales saying they\nwill forward it to technical support and get back to me. \n04.12.2013 - Third email to sales saying that technical support never\ncontacted me back.

vulnerable to linking attacks, potentially allowing a\nlocal user to overwrite arbitrary files. \n\nBackground\n==========\n\nlm_sensors is a software package that provides drivers for monitoring\nthe temperatures, voltages, and fans of Linux systems with hardware\nmonitoring devices. When\nthe pwmconfig script of lm_sensors is executed, this would result in\nthe file being overwritten with the rights of the user running the\nscript, which typically is the root user. \n\nWorkaround\n==========\n\nThere is no known workaround at this time. \n\nResolution\n==========\n\nAll lm_sensors users should upgrade to the latest version:\n\n    # emerge --sync\n    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose "">=sys-apps/lm_sensors-2.9.1-r1""\n\nReferences\n==========\n\n  [ 1 ] CAN-2005-2672\n        http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CAN-2005-2672\n\nAvailability\n============\n\nThis GLSA and any updates to it are available for viewing at\nthe Gentoo Security Website:\n\n  http://security.gentoo.org/glsa/glsa-200508-19.xml\n\nConcerns?\n=========\n\nSecurity is a primary focus of Gentoo Linux and ensuring the\nconfidentiality and security of our users machines is of utmost\nimportance to us.
